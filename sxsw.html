#NativeScript - Future of Mobile App Development
---

template: nativescript

##Mobile landscape today
 - iOS
 - Objective C
 - GO
 - React Native
 - Java
 - Web Views - Phonegap/Cordova, Ionic

##Why is NativeScript different?
 - Native SDK access via a JS bridge.
 - No webviews, No DOM, an actual app.
 - Full Platform API access - built at runtime.
 - Highly Performant.*
 - Develop business logic with JS.
 - Design and style with XML and CSS.
 - Creates modules that expose the native device for iOS and Android and these modules at runtime target the platform. You're building and produce native code.

#What did they talk about?

###Benefits Today
 - Skills Reuse.
 - Code Reuse.
 - Community Ecosystem of Modules - NPM.

###Benefits Tomorrow
 - Shared code across the web and native mobile apps.
 - Continuous Deployment. 
 - Build a factory for your apps.

#Building Influential Tech Brands
---

template: techbrands
#WHO?
 - Head of Strategy from Droga5
 
 - CCO from SquareSpace
 
 - Startup Founder from Hello Alfred
 
 - CDO from Under Armour
 

#What did they talk about?
 *What makes startups successful?*

 - How they succeed, challenges, failures, painpoints, strategies?
 - How do you monetize ads and startups?
 - Was actually disappointed in this considering the great brands involved.  I don't know what it was but I was expecting more energy from these individuals.  It seemed like it was a more of a pitch process of how Droga5 works with technology companies to create ads and why you should go with them for business.

#Brene Brown

![Picture of Brene Brown](http://static.wixstatic.com/media/cb5c97_6865c67f308d4ab983152e421d71d83e.jpg_256 "Brene Brown")

##Daring Greatly

  - Accidental Ted Talk that garnered over 24 million views.
  - Speaks about how you achieve the best of yourself when you are vulnerable and how we as humans tend to think of vulnerability as a negative trait.  Her talk is about embracing it.

### Why is this relevant?
  - Programming moves very fast and the ability to know everything is impossible so by embracing that you wont know everything and you may look to others that you don't know what you’re doing it will eventually lead to large growth because you will be pushing your comfort boundaries.

# PATTERN LIBRARIES

---

template: patterns

# What did they talk about? 
 - Talk about the IBM Watson Design Guide.
 - Built with Sass and available via Bower.
 - Talked about the importance of having a style guide and how it’s played into designing and developing standards for Watson.
 - Showed demonstrations on how to create components within their style guide, create mixins, extends, etc.
 - Open source project so anyone can contribute.
 - Covered how their build process is set up and how the developers communicate with each other since the team is very large.

#REACT

---

template: ios-react


#What was covered?
  
### React
  - React Elements and Components
  - Basic Rendering
  - Props and State
  - JSX 
  - Events
  - Made a simple to-do list

### REACT Native
  - A how to on creating several basic mobile apps with React Native.
  - Went over how it compares in terms of other languages, NativeScript, Objective C, Swift, and Java etc.
  - Gives web developers who don't know Objective C a way to write 'native' mobile applications using their existing skills. 
  - Can be done in really fast dev cycles.  Can build devices that connect to your local package manager. 
  - Cross platform, can use other code too Objective C, Swift, Java etc. 

---

#Takeaways

- React is good at pushing changes to the DOM, refreshing, manage UI updates.
- React is all about building reusable components.
- React can make Application-specific components that can carry application-specific APIs and internal logic. This is more than a DOM-updating library; it is a new abstraction and framework for building views.
- Difference between React and React Native, one is for browsers one is for iOS and Android.
- Fast performance for both.
- Both are very easy to get started and have a quick ramp up time to start producing.

# BUILDING OFFILNE WEB

---
template: offline-web
# Offline isn't the biggest enemy - wifi-connection is

- Offline is not an error
- Offline is a fact of mobile life
- An app that doesn't work offline is broken

###How do we combat this? 

- Storing assets offline like App Cache
- Or use Local Storage - ex. INDEXDB
- Use a service worker

###What is a service worker?

- JavaScript file that sits between your app and network.
- Creates a richer offline experiences, periodic background syncs, push notifications.  Functionality that would normally require a native application is coming to the web
- Examples are Email, Twitter, and Google Chrome Dinosaur Game
- They start and stop when they are being used.  So there is no need for a persistent state. 

##[Service Workers!!](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/)

##WHY? 

Not just mobile first, offline first.

###Performance
  - 1.7 billion dollars in lost sales
  - 46% would not return to a poor performing site

###UX
  - robustness
  - less load on server
  - no data loss
  - providing a fast reliable network non dependent experience is important 
  - Internet connection speeds will get worse based on more users coming online. 

###87% of the mobile connections in India are 2G or 60KBS.
###15 page loads = 1 hour of work at minimum wage in India.

#Front to Back: Node.JS for Client Side Developers

---

template: node

#What was covered? 

###Why you would use node?
 - Getting apps up and running is easy. 
 - Flexible.
 - Can roll your own JS. 

###Tutorials
 - Went over setting up services
 - Separating those services
 - Setting up express
 - How Node handles the event loop (never block it, use async operations for long tasks)
 - adding some preprocessors (Jade, Stylus)
 - Using views and routes to create a User login
 - Set up passport for User Authentication.
 - Unit test your code
 - Watch out for memory leaks

# Kicking Sass - PostCSS

---

template: sass

#What was covered?

####Some of the problems with CSS
  - Cross Browser compatibility issues
  - Vendor prefixes
  - No vars, imports, nested selectors, functions, mixins, color manipulations

##Developers have been filling in the gaps with preprocessors

###Problems with that?

  - Putting layers of abstraction between the code we write and the code the browsers can read.
  - Own syntax
  - Must be compiled
  - Browsers are catching up

---

template: sass

#Takeaways

- Postproccessors
- It's not about when you process your code its about what you're processing. 
- Enter PostCSS and Babel
- PostCSS is modular.  Sass gives you everything out of the box.  PostCSS you can pick and choose what you use. 

###Advantages

- Write CSS with CSS
- Can write your own plugins with JavaScript
- Faster compile times

###Disadvantages

- Support is still lagging
- Not refined in some areas, calc, mixins/extends.
- Ugly syntax as of right now.
